# Specification v1.7: Licensing and Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)

This document provides a high-level overview of the licensing model and Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) considerations for the MagnetarAion system.

## 1. Licensing Model

### 1.1. Free Tier
- A free tier will be available for small teams, with the following limitations:
  - Up to 10 users.
  - Full core functionality.
  - Up to 3 helpdesk agents.

### 1.2. Cloud (SaaS)
- The cloud version will be licensed on a subscription basis, per user, per month.
- Discounts will be available for:
  - Volume licensing.
  - Startups.
  - Non-governmental organizations (NGOs).
  - Educational institutions.

### 1.3. Server (Self-Hosted)
- The server version will be available as a perpetual license, sold in user packs.
- An annual maintenance fee will be required for support and updates.
- This model allows for better control over CAPEX and OPEX.

## 2. Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)

- When evaluating the TCO of MagnetarAion, it is important to consider the potential for replacing multiple other tools (e.g., Jira, Confluence, Zendesk) with a single, integrated system. This can lead to significant cost savings in licensing, maintenance, and training.
