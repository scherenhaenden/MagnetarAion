# MagnetarAion Project

## 🎯 Project Goal

To develop **MagnetarAion**, a modern, highly functional, and user-friendly issue tracking and project management system comparable to other leading systems.

## 📝 Core Functional Requirements (MVP)

The initial version of MagnetarAion will focus on delivering core, usable functionalities as early as possible.

*   **User and Project Management:** User authentication, project creation, and team assignment.
*   **Issue Tracking:** Create, view, and edit issues with core fields (Title, Description, Assignee, etc.).
*   **Activity/Comments:** Comment on issues and view a history of changes.
*   **Basic Filtering/Search:** Filter issues by project, assignee, state, and type.
*   **Workflow:** Simple state transitions for issues (e.g., Open → In Progress → Resolved → Closed).

## ⚙️ Technical Architecture and Stack

| Component  | Technology                             |
| :--- |:--- |
| **Backend**  | **Python** (FastAPI or Django REST)    |
| **Frontend** | **Angular**                            |
| **Database** | **PostgreSQL** (recommended)           |

## 🛡️ Quality and Testing Principles

Testing is a critical, non-negotiable component of the development process. We will follow a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach and ensure comprehensive test coverage, including unit, integration, end-to-end (E2E), and API tests.

## 🚀 Iterative Development and Early Usability

The development process will prioritize the delivery of a Minimum Usable Feature Set to allow the team to use the tool to manage its own development process as early as possible.

## 🔗 External Integration Requirement: GitHub

MagnetarAion will be able to connect to GitHub from an early stage, with initial goals including linking projects to repositories and eventually tracking commits and branches.
