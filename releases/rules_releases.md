# Release Documentation Rules

This document outlines the process for documenting releases.

## Monthly Release Files

At the beginning of each month, a new Markdown file must be created in this directory. The file name should follow the format `yyyyMM.md`, where `yyyy` is the four-digit year and `MM` is the two-digit month (e.g., `202311.md`).

## Content

Each monthly release file should contain a detailed log of all significant changes, features, and bug fixes that were released during that month. For every merged pull request that introduces a user-facing change, it's important to check if it has been documented in the corresponding monthly file.
